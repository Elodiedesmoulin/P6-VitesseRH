### Introduction

**Vitesse RH** is a candidate management app developed in SwiftUI using the MVVM architecture.  
It was created as part of the final hands-on project of the **OpenClassrooms iOS Developer Path**.  
The app allows HR teams to browse, add, edit, and favorite candidates with a smooth user experience and reliable data flow from a REST API.

---

### Features

- **List of candidates** loaded from an external API
- **Add, edit and delete candidate** information
- **Mark candidates as favorites**
- **Search and filter candidates**
- **Structured app architecture with MVVM**
- **Responsive and clean UI built with SwiftUI**
- **Proper error handling and loading states**

---

### Architecture

This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern for better maintainability and testability.

#### View
Built using SwiftUI â€“ reacts to data changes and provides dynamic interface components.

#### ViewModel
Handles business logic, API calls, and formatting of data for the views. Decouples UI from the data layer.

#### Model
Defines the data structures for candidates, API endpoints, and decoding logic (conforming to `Codable`).
